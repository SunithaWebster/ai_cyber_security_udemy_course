# The Complete Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security

A record of my progress through 'The Complete Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security' Udemy course, found here, https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-artificial-intelligence-for-cyber-security-2021/

The course combines Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning, to create AI for Real-World applications.

I will learn key AI concepts and intuition training, covering:

- How to start building AI.
- How to solve AI problems in the cyber security field.



## Overview of Learning Objectives

1. I will learn to code self-improving AI for a range of purposes, step-by-step.

2. I will complete learn-by-doing, Intuition Tutorials â€“ developing understanding of what I am doing and why through coding rather than theory for the sake of it

3. I will tackle more than ten, real-world solutions, of varying structure and difficulties.
