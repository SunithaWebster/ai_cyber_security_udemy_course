        "In machine learning, the goal is to create a program that is able to perform tasks it has never been explicitly taught to perform. The way we do this, is to use data we have collected to **train** or **fit** a mathematical or statistical model.  The data used to fit the model is called **training data**.\n",

        "To solve this problem, machine learning engineers set aside a portion of the data, called **test data** and use it to assess the performance of the trained model, as opposed to including it as part of the training dataset.\n",

The `test_size=0.2` parameter means that the testing set consists of 20% of the original data, while the remainder is placed in the training set.  The `random_state` parameter allows us to reproduce the same, randomly generated split.\n",
